_Modeling the global atmospheric dispersion and deposition of radionuclides released from the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant accident._ 

{{< youtube ol98YUd8Jes >}}

The [EMAC](http://www.messy-interface.org/) atmospheric chemistry â€“ general circulation model was used, with circulation dynamics nudged towards [ECMWF](http://www.ecmwf.int/) ERA-Interim reanalysis data. We applied a resolution of approximately 0.5 degrees in latitude and longitude. The model accounts for emissions and transport of the radioactive isotopes <sup>131</sup>I and <sup>137</sup>Cs, and removal processes through precipitation, particle sedimentation and dry deposition. In addition, we simulated the release of <sup>133</sup>Xe, a noble gas that can be regarded as a passive transport tracer of contaminated air. 

The source terms are based on Chino et al. (2011) and Stohl et al. (2012); especially the emission estimates of <sup>131</sup>I are associated with a high degree of uncertainty. The calculated concentrations have been compared to station observations by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation ([CTBTO](http://www.ctbto.org/)). 

We calculated that about 80% of the radioactivity from Fukushima which was released to the atmosphere deposited into the Pacific Ocean. In Japan a large inhabited land area was contaminated by more than 40 kBq/m<sup>2</sup>. We also estimated the inhalation and 50-year dose by <sup>137</sup>Cs, <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>131</sup>I to which the people in Japan are exposed.
