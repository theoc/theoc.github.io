Our publication on modelling the global
atmospheric transport and
deposition of radionuclides
from the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear accident (doi: [10.5194/acp-13-1425-2013](http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-13-1425-2013)) was selected and featured in the European Comission's Science for Enviroment Policy Newsletter.

Our study on the transport of radioactive isotopes from Fukushima in the two months after the nuclear incident suggests that they were at official levels of contamination for 34,000 km&sup2; of Japan, and that 2.8% of iodine radionuclides from the event were calculated to have reached the EU.

###Science for Environment Policy:
[Science for Environment Policy](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/research/newsalert/index_en.htm) is a free news and information service published by the [Directorate-General Environment, European Commission](http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/environment/index_en.htm). It is designed to help busy policymakers keep up-to-date with the latest environmental research findings needed to design, implement and regulate effective policies.
All content undergoes a review process.
An editorial team scans a range of respected, reviewed journals for potential studies, which are then assessed by an independent network of European advisors for quality and policy relevance,
and a team of experienced science writers draft articles based on these studies.
