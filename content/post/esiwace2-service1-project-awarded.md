The Cyprus Institute is awarded one of the four ESiWACE2 Service 1 call projects with the EMAC (ECHAM-MESSy Atmosphere Climate) model, a numerical chemistry and climate simulation system that includes sub-models describing tropospheric and middle atmosphere processes and their interaction with oceans, land and human influences.

The Netherlands eScience Center and Atos-Bull grant [four proposals](https://www.esiwace.eu/services/hpc-userservices/four-projects-awarded-funding-in-the-esiwace2-service-1-call) within the ESiWACE2 project. The granted projects will receive consultancy, advice, and engineering from the research software engineers at the eScience center and Atos. These collaborative projects will allow experts in high-performance computing (HPC) and accelerated computing to work together with the model developers to advance the software so that (parts of) the model can be executed efficiently on modern CPU processors or modern computing accelerators, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).

Acceleration of the EMAC chemistry mechanism can reduce the number of CPU-nodes required and time-to-solution by a factor of 5 while using an atmospheric chemical mechanism (in terms of number of species and reactions) that is an order of magnitude more complex than the current state-of-the-art.

[ESiWACE2](https://www.esiwace.eu) aims to improve model efficiency and prepare the software to enable model execution on existing and near-future hardware architectures and simulate experiments at unprecedented grid resolutions or ensemble sizes. In addition, it will include computationally expensive physical processes that were previously unfeasible.
