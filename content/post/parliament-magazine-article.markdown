Our article titled "New insights on radioactivity from Fukushima" was published in the Green Week Issue (Issue 370, 27 May 2013) of the EU [Parliament Magazine](https://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu).

The article is based on our study of the dispersion of radioactive isotopes from Fukushima, during several months after the nuclear reactor accidents in the framework of an ERC Advanced Researcher
Grant. The results suggest that an area
of more than 34,000 km<sup>2</sup> in Japan was
radioactively contaminated, and that
about 3% of the radioactive iodine reached
Europe (publication doi: [10.5194/acp-13-1425-2013](http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-13-1425-2013)).
