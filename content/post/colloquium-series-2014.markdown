A significant part of The Cyprus Instituteâ€™s mission is the promotion and dissemination of scientific knowledge through public lectures, colloquiums and seminars. In this framework the Institute founded in 2010 the Public Talks and Colloquium Series. The lectures are delivered by prominent scientists from local and international Universities and Institutes.

All events are presented in English, and are open to the public. Unless otherwise noted, all Colloquia take place at The Cyprus Institute, Athalassa Campus - Guy Ourisson Building, Seminar Room (1st floor) and are scheduled for 45 minutes, followed by 15 minutes for questions by the audience.
